When inside the parent view (StackedSheetsView) navigating the content inside the "Brick" sheet (Card1View), the touch events seem to randomly stop working, not allowing navigation between the child views (Card1View > DamageType1View > Definition1View). It will however allow a longpress to navigate. Scrolling and back navigation remain unaffect.
